### Introduction 

Canada has experienced significant growth in its housing market over the past several years, with prices varying widely depending on location, type of property, and local market conditions. Major cities like Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal are known for their high housing costs, driven by factors such as strong demand, limited supply, and foreign investment.
